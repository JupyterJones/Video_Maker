Here's an example:

```python
# Install venv
!pip install virtualenv

# Specify the path where you want to create the virtual environment
venv_path = '/path/to/your/venv'

# Create a virtual environment
!python -m venv $venv_path

# Activate the virtual environment (this step might not work directly in the notebook)
!source $venv_path/bin/activate

To ensure that your project runs smoothly with Flask, MoviePy, voice creation, and OpenCV, you'll need to list the required packages in your requirements.txt file. Below is a requirements.txt file that includes the necessary packages for these functionalities:

plaintext

flask==2.1.1
moviepy==1.0.3
gtts==2.2.3
opencv-python==4.8.0.74
numpy==1.22.3
scipy==1.8.0
werkzeug==2.2.3
waitress==2.1.2
pydub==0.25.1
requests==2.27.1
setuptools==65.5.1
urllib3==1.26.9

Explanation of Packages:

    flask==2.1.1: Flask framework for creating web applications.
    moviepy==1.0.3: MoviePy library for video editing.
    gtts==2.2.3: Google Text-to-Speech library for creating voice files.
    opencv-python==4.8.0.74: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
    numpy==1.22.3: NumPy library for numerical computations (required by MoviePy and OpenCV).
    scipy==1.8.0: SciPy library for scientific computing (used by MoviePy).
    werkzeug==2.2.3: WSGI utility library for Flask.
    waitress==2.1.2: WSGI server for production deployment of Flask applications.
    pydub==0.25.1: PyDub library for audio manipulation.
    requests==2.27.1: Requests library for making HTTP requests.
    setuptools==65.5.1: Setuptools for package management.
    urllib3==1.26.9: HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling.

Usage:

    Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory.
    Copy and paste the above content into the requirements.txt file.
    Install the packages by running the following command in your terminal:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the necessary packages specified in the requirements.txt file, ensuring your environment is set up correctly for Flask, MoviePy, voice creation, and OpenCV functionalities.

# Now, you can install packages within the virtual environment
!pip install package_name

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Deactivate the virtual environment (this step might not work directly in the notebook)
!deactivate
```
from flask import Flask

    return 'Hello, this is your Flask app running on the LAN!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

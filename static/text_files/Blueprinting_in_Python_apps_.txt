Blueprinting in Python apps.
user
When you blueprint a directory into an an app.py does the entire app go into the __init__.py ?
ChatGPT
No, not necessarily. Blueprinting a directory into an `app.py` file typically involves registering blueprints within the `app.py` file, but the entire app doesn't go into the `__init__.py`. The `__init__.py` file is used to define a package in Python and can contain initialization code, but it's not where the entire app is defined. Each blueprint typically has its own directory structure and may include its own `__init__.py` file, but it's not a requirement for using blueprints.

What goes in the __init__.py
ChatGPT
In the `__init__.py` file of a Python package, you typically include initialization code that you want to execute when the package is imported. This can include defining variables, importing modules, or performing any other setup tasks necessary for your package. Additionally, it's common to use the `__all__` variable to specify which modules should be imported when using `from package import *`.
